                <li> Hello again and welcome to my page! </li>
           <br>
                <li> This is Darah, and from this point forward, you are going to learn more about me.</li>
           <br>
                <li>I have graduated from Jubilee High School in 2016</li> 
           <br>
                 <li> I started an undergrad degree in Political Science at McMaster University in 2017</li>  
           <br>
                <li> Having a linguistic background made me super interested in languages growing up.</li> 
           <br>
                <li>With that being said, I figured languages are not only spoken. </li>
           <br>
                <li>I speak a little bit of German, French and Spanish, and I believe that one should never stop learning languages as they open more doors and provide more opportunities.</li>
           <br>
                <li>The languages I'm learning today are a bit different in the structure, but are the same in terms of opportunity providing!</li>
           <br>
                <li> These are programming languages which I fell in love ever since I started learning them.</li>
           <br>
                <li> I want to gain all the knowledge I can in programming to become a great developer sometime soon! In case you were wondering, blasting my music to the max and spending my time learning is my JAM! </li>
            </ul>

            CAUTION: 
            This is where it gets serious!

           I have a theory that one should try to gain experience in any field possible. Meaning: if you get a job as a bridal stylist, take it.
           I have a pretty diverse list of experiences. I have ACTUALLY worked in a bridal shop before. I took some makeup artist tasks before. I worked as a receptionist, call center agent, data entry clerk, up to a project coordinator and VP external affairs. 
           They are pretty different I know. But, in the journey of finding the true self, I had to experience it all.

        <h4> Time Away </h4>
        <article>
            Amman is one of my favourite cities around the world. However, spending some time away is necessary in my opinion. I visited some cities along the way and got to go through a lot of different adventures. 
            It is crazy how we can learn a lot just by interacting with other people around us! 
            Let's try that out right here on my webpage.
